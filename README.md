As a SAS programmer working in a bank, my interests lie in software development, data science, and data analysis. 
I am skilled at collaborating with team members. I enjoy sharing knowledge and working in a friendly and supportive environment. 
Problem-solving, particularly technical issues, is one of my strengths. 
I am open to new ideas and appreciate innovative approaches to work.

I am an advocate of Agile/Scrum methodologies, which can improve team coordination and enhance the quality, efficiency, and job satisfaction.

My programming language expertise includes SAS 4GL, Python, R, Oracle SQL, and PL/SQL.
